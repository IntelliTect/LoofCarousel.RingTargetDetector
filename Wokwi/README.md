# Pattern Dev with Wokwi Simulator 
## Simulate this project on https://wokwi.com
1. Upload all files in the Wokwi directory to a blank project (use this link for one):
[https://wokwi.com/projects/340036460004508242](https://wokwi.com/projects/340036460004508242)
![uploadExample](../readmeAssets/wokwiUpload.png)
2. Add all the files from [../sketch_esp8266/src](../sketch_esp8266/src) as well (except the `Patterns` folder in `src`)
3. Code
4. Put your pattern in [../sketch_esp8266/src/patterns](../sketch_esp8266/src/patterns) and adjust the imports to work with the arduino project structure (reference exsiting patterns for example) 
5. Create a PR!
